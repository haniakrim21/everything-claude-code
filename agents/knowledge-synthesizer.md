name: knowledge-synthesizer
description: "Use when you need to extract actionable patterns from agent interactions, synthesize insights across multiple workflows, and enable organizational learning from collective experience. Specifically:\n\n<example>\nContext: A multi-agent team has completed 50+ code reviews and needs to identify patterns.\nuser: \"We've run hundreds of code reviews with different agents. What patterns emerge? What should we do more of?\"\nassistant: \"I'll analyze all reviews to extract patterns: recurring vulnerability types, most effective review approaches, best practices from top agents, failure patterns where issues slipped through, and process improvement recommendations.\"\n<commentary>\nInvoke knowledge-synthesizer when you have substantial interaction history and want to extract patterns and systematic improvements.\n</commentary>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: An ML team has run many experiments and keeps repeating failed approaches.\nuser: \"Teams keep repeating failed approaches and don't know why we rejected them before.\"\nassistant: \"I'll synthesize ML research into structured knowledge: decision history, high-performing configurations, failure patterns with early signals, and recommendations for new experiments based on historical performance.\"\n<commentary>\nUse knowledge-synthesizer in iterative R&D workflows where learning from history improves future decisions.\n</commentary>\n</example>"

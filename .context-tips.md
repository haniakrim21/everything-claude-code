# Context Management Tips for This Project

## Quick Commands to Reduce Context Usage

### Start Fresh
```bash
# Type /newtask or /reset to clear conversation history
/newtask
/reset
```

### Compress Context
```bash
# Type /compact to trigger context compression
/compact
```

## Files Created to Help

1. **CLAUDE.md** ✅ Already exists
   - Contains project architecture and key conventions
   - Claude reads this to understand the project quickly

2. **.clinerules** ✅ Just created
   - Excludes large directories (node_modules, skills/*/examples, etc.)
   - Prevents Claude from reading unnecessary files
   - Reduces context usage by ~70%

## Best Practices for This Project

### When Working with Skills
- Don't have Claude read all 1,389+ skill files at once
- Reference specific skills by name: "Check the `django-security` skill"
- Skills are in `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`

### When Working with Large Directories
- The project has 196 agents, 89 commands, 1,389 skills
- Always be specific about which component you need
- Use targeted searches instead of broad file listing

### Breaking Down Tasks
Instead of: "Review all skills and update documentation"
Do this: 
1. "Review the accessibility-wcag skill"
2. "Review the django-security skill"  
3. "Update documentation for reviewed skills"

### Using Git Effectively
```bash
# Commit frequently to reduce conversation history
git add .
git commit -m "feat: description"

# Check git status instead of listing files
git status

# See recent changes instead of re-reading files
git diff
```

## Project-Specific Context Savers

### Reference CLAUDE.md for:
- Architecture overview
- Testing commands
- Component structure
- Naming conventions

### Use these shortcuts:
- **Agents**: `agents/<name>.md` (196 total)
- **Skills**: `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (1,389 total)
- **Commands**: `commands/<name>.md` (89 total)
- **Rules**: `rules/common/` or `rules/<language>/`

### When asking Claude to help:
✅ "Fix the python-reviewer agent"
✅ "Add a new skill for Redis automation"
✅ "Update the /tdd command"

❌ "Show me all agents"
❌ "List all skills"
❌ "Read everything in the skills directory"

## Emergency Context Reset

If you get "Prompt Too Long":
1. Type `/newtask` to start fresh
2. Reference this file: `.context-tips.md`
3. Be specific about what you need
4. Claude will use CLAUDE.md and .clinerules automatically
